## Planning Story

The first stage of the planning process was to create a wireframe and an Entity Relationship Diagram for this application.  In this process I was able to set expectations on what I needed to accomplish, along with a realistic timeframe in which to do so.
Next I set up resources and materials I would need in order to complete the project. This consisted of organizing all the martials and setting up documents for quick and easy access, in a flow that would be the best use of my time.
After all these are completed, I then set up my file structure along with any dependencies I would need to get started.  Once they were all ready to go I then created a new repository in which I pushed up the main branch of my application.  Now I was ready to start developing!


### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new album
- As a user I want to search for a single album
- As a user I want to sort the collection
- As a user I want to add comments to the album

### Technologies Used

- Mongo DB
- Ajax
- JSON
- Node.js

### Unsolved Problems
- Still need to add imagaes for each album and store them.
- Would like to add a more input fields with a drop down menu and would like to add user notes along with a personal rating system per album.
